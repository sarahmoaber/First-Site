# First-Site

This is my first program using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, collaborating with other student.

In this project, we created a site that is concerned with providing comfort and beauty services and the ease of booking any service the customer wants.
We made sure that the site is clear in the services provided and their details.
On our site, we aim to reach every woman looking for beauty and places of rest and relaxation, and we hope to serve them in the best way.
Our website offers many services, including:

    See photos of the salon and get an idea about it.
    View all services.
    Show Prices.
    View a brief overview of each service.
    The ability to specify the required service and make a reservation
