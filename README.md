# First-Site

This is my first program using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, collaborating with other student.

In this project, we created a site that is concerned with providing comfort and beauty services and the ease of booking any service the customer wants.
The website includes services such as creating an account, making reservations, and viewing prices and available services. The website was developed using node.js, javascript, mongoDB, Html, CSS
